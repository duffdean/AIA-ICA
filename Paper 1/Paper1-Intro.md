# 1. Introduction & Background

In 2015 Wang, S., Lv, W., & Song, W conducted a series of experiments to observe the behaviours of ants in a mass escape situation, in which the movement of ants trapped in a room filling up with repellent was noted, as well as their collective organisation into lanes of traffic to facilitate a swift escape unhindered by the mass obstruction that would have occurred otherwise (John, Schadschneider, Chowdhury, Nishinari, 2004/2009). In one such experiment, ants were noted to have formed into two separate lines converging into the same route. Though this resulted in frequent head-on collisions that would contribute to the diminishing of escape efficiency, the traffic along this route appeared to maintain its organisation compared to other separate outbound and return trails. A conclusion was reached, in that the head on collisions may have allowed for an exchange of information between the colliding parties (Burd , Aranwela , 2003).

With this in mind, further studies were performed, with the aim of observing ant behaviours in situations comparable to those experienced by human groups. One such study, which involved an experiment in which ants were placed into a container with two symmetrically located exits, showed a “symmetry breaking” phenomenon during which the majority of ants appeared to favour one exit more often than the other (Altshuler, Ramos, Núñez, Fernández, Batista-Leyva, Noda, 2005). Through comparison of these results with those presented in the paper ‘Enhancing the safety of pedestrians during emergency egress’ it was noted that ants could ehxibit behaviour comparable, if not precisely matching, human behaviours in similar situations, and as such ants could serve as a model for humans in some cases (Shiwakoti, Sarvi, Rose, Burd, 2009). This information forms the bases of the experiments conducted by Wang, Lv and Song, with an aim of determining whether the response of a group of ants when faced with a threatening situation can somewhat mimic the response of humans in an evacuation scenario such as a fire and, in the event of the contrary, the extent of the differences between the two (Parisi, Soria, Josens, 2015).

The experiments conducted investigate this hypothesis involved a clear acrylic "room" measuring 7.0cm wide x 8.0cm long and 0.6cm high, with a single exit of variable width and a piece of filter paper soaked with citronella oil, a powerful ant repellent. The height of the room was set to 0.6cm to prevent ants from climbing on top of each other and the exit widths were 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 cm, referred to in the research paper as 1w, 2w, 3w, 4w, 5w and 6w respectively. These widths were based on the average head width of each ant, determined to be approximately 0.3cm. Thus an exit width 0.5cm was deemed sufficiently narrow to allow single ant through at any one time.

The ants employed for the experiments were of the Camponotus Japonicus species, a member of the Formicidae family commonly known as the ‘Japanese carpenter ant’. In each experiment approximately 30 ants were used, all originating from the same nest, though the same ants were never used in the repellent experiment more than once, as a means of ensuring the experiments remain as humane as possible.

To initialise the experiment the 30 ants were placed in the room with the exit closed and the repellent was then added to the opposite side of the exit in the room. The exit was then opened to the initial 1w, and the experiment we considered underway with the introduction of the repellent. The precise moment the first ant succeeded in finding the exit was marked as time zero, with the time taken for each ant escaping there after being recorded in seconds following that first exit. The experiment ended if no ants passed through the exit for one minute. This process was then repeated for all the aforementioned exit widths. An additional experiment was also conducted with the same configuration, though with water in the place of repellent, to serve as a control experiment to compare against those performed with repellent (Wang, Lv, Song, 2015).

Based on the above experiments detailed in the paper authored by Wang, S., Lv, W., & Song, W, A virtual model was eventually devised, with the intention of adapting the environment, participants (the ants, in this case) and any variables described into a NetLogo simulation. This model allowed for the creation of a high-level simulation of the experiments' environment which in turn assisted in decisions with regard to the actions and interactions of each ant.
