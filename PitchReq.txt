[Anticipated Behaviours]
- Ants retreat from repellent and attempt to seek an exit
- Ants are blind - they can't see, but they can sense through other means.
- Ants emit pheromones (involuntarily?) that are picked up by other ants and can serve to guide them.
  - Potential for emergent behaviour: Ants may form something resembling an orderly queue as a result of those pheromones
  - Potential for emergent behaviour: Ants may accidentally lead themselves into a perpetual spiral
    - Potential for emergent behaviour: ...which they might also potentially escape.

[Agent Deliberation and Interaction]
- As stated earlier, ants are visually blind and depend on other senses to navigate.
- Pheromones serve as a means to signal other ants to something of interest and, in a sense, establish a momentary leadership as other ants pick up the trail and follow it.
  - This could, however, potentially lead to ants at the front of the "queue" accidentally catching the trail left by rearmost ants, pulling the entire cluster into an Ouroboros-like spiral that will be difficult, if not impossible to escape.
