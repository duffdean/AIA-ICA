Each patch holds an aptly-named variable which represents the amount of

* Means of abstraction
* Representation of repellent
* Placement of repellent
* Spread of repellent
* Implementation of repellent in model
  * User Interface
  * Variables
* Difficulties faced

## 2.2. Room/Map setup
* Means of abstraction
* Representation of environment
* Placement of walls
* Placement of exit

  * (May already be explained in prior section)
* Wall behaviour
* Open space behaviour
* Implementation of map in model
  * User Interface
  * Variables
* Difficulties faced
